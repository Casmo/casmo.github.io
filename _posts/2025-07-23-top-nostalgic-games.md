title: Top games that bring nostalgia back to life
---

While big triple A games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and cyberpunk 2077 are amazing story telling games with fenominal graphics, sometimes I long for a more different experience. I'm looking for a part of me when times where different. I'm looking for something nostalgic. Maybe I'm in search for Fernweh.

<!--break-->

Fernweh? It is a German word that cannot be translated, but is described as "a place or time you want to visit but never been too. Reverse homesickness or yearning to a distance place.". I think this feeling comes from the game 'the longest journey'. Maybe I was so drawn into the story, maybe I felt in love with April Ryan. Maybe both. But the emotions where strong and every time I see a Stark or Arcadia like setting somewhere that captures that feeling I'm Fernweh.

Here are some of those games that give me similar vibes, just by looking at them. Give them some love.
