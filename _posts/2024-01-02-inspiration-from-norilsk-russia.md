title: Inspiration from Norilsk, Russia
---

I'm always drawn to dystopian style in movies, games and books. I think this love for (more cyberpunk) artform comes from my childhood game "The Longest Journey". Especially the Stark version of the game. Fortunately for me, the world is filled with filled with this kind of worlds. Fiction and non-fiction.
